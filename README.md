An open catalogue of identifiers and data formats to help charities publish data in a way that is easier to use and link. Identifiers are standard codes for identifying things like organisations, categories or places. Formats are standard ways of publishing data about a thing such as a service provided by a charity, or a funding award.

## Identifiers

* [Identify the nations of the UK that data applies to](identifiers/uk-nations.md)

## Formats

* [Publish information about a service that is provided to the public and the geographical area it covers](formats/service-provision.md)

## Proposing an identifier or format

Anyone can propose a new challenge for an area where a standard identifier or format for publishing data could be useful.
